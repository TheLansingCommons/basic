# Scary book database


## Instructions

Create a text document (or email) and record the:

[[book(edition)]]:page:[[date]]
- [[meter]]::measure
- [[meter]]::measure
- [[meter]]::measure
- [[meter]]::measure

Take as many samples as you want and include any secondary information you feel appropriate, while sticking to the naming system we use. As long as each unit is self contained with, you can use any order you want. The upload document does not need to be complete. The data will be transfered into the database. You can use any medium - paper is fine - but do not expect it to be processed immediately.

-----------------
## for example:

[[An Inspector Morse Mystery - The Jewel That was Ours (first)]]:49:[[4/3/24]]
- [[mystery]]::3
- [[enjoyment]]::5
- [[characters]]::10
- [[notes]]::Something about the story, etc. 

-----------------

## Note on meters and notes

You can have as many meters as you like. Make them up, or try to use the predefined ones we are using. If you decide to use your meter differently then what is specified, or you invent one that you want other people know how to use, include a section for specification like this:

example

```
# Specification

- [[meter]] - redefinition and information on measuring
- [[meter]] - redefinition and information on measuring
- [[meter]] - redefinition and information on measuring
- [[meter]] - redefinition and information on measuring
- [[meter]] - redefinition and information on measuring
etc

```

This allows you to define as many as you want, and if there is a need to check your measures again standard usuage, we have a way of referencing that. So feel free to experiment, but know that using the standard measures helps us develop more signals.
