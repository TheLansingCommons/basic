# The Lansing Commons

April 3, 2024

Hello - My name is Michael Penta.

The goal of this project is to provide my community with a common point of reference, where they can communicate openly with one another. 


# Instructions

Send anything you want to thelansingcommons@gmail.com

The commons will be updated at least once a week, and each time they will be reset. Check the area for updated flyers if things stop working


# Standard list of Folders

Use this list to help you think of where and how to organize whatever you are uploading. You are free to invent new folders, and even folders just for yourself.Remember, it resets every week. If nothing is there, the folder won't be there.
