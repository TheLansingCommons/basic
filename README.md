# The Lansing Commons

April 3, 2024

The goal of this project was to provide my community with a..... mathmatically appropriate social network. That is a loaded and vague statement, and hopefully it enrages someone. As a sociologist and more importantly as a fine arts major of the sculpture type - I find rage makers are good first canidates. They test the limits of the thing by immediately trying to break it. I love it. 

The diabolically evil is also a Lansing Favorite. But I am not here to conjure the dark forces. I am here, as a citizen of our fine city, to help the mayor. 

Recently, it appears, the mayor was struggling to communicate to the public. He has a big idea, and thought it was a sure bet and it wasn't. And now, he needed to connect with his people, so that he could get the city council approval. Nothing strange about that. When to the papers. The published it. I heard something. sorta by accident. 

Why is that? I am not blaming you Mr. Mayor, but why was that hard?

(long pause - hell go for a walk, and come back. ready?)

Facebook sucks - but more importantly, it doesn't fit. It never fit, and its making us crazy, but lets be clear, it sucks.

This - the Lansing Commons - is somthing different. It tries to be more accessible and more private for specific group of people in a specific place. Like a city. 

It doesn't take a lot to do that, and nothing I am doing is especially technical. Its clever. But I am hoping that in doing this, as simply and cheaply as possible, people will mimic and clone me. And something will be created generally, that will support a type of communication and social behavior that I think is necessary.

I have big plans and I dumped them all to make this as simple as possible. If for whatever reason you can't access the website anymore - go find a new flyer. They'll be put up around the city. They will have a QR code, and should  be dated. As we progress, old flyers will time out, and new flyers with current codes will be put up.

# Instructions

basically just look through everything. This initial upload is something of a personal gallery for me, but thats because no one knows anything yet. When you have looked inside and decided to share something, either upload it to this repo, or  send it to thelansingcommons@gmail.com. This is not long term, but whatever.

Limits? sure. Pretty much anything I don't like or don't want to get involved with. Like I said, copy me if you want, but this just a shift in perspective of how we can do this most effeciently. Facebook does not make sense and its literally killing us. A Mayor should be able to easily speak to his community, his community should be able to speak to each other, and it shouldn't be such a difficult, cluster-fuck. 

Once a week is my goal, but initially, expect it to be updated regularly. So I train you like animals, with cheap dopamine. Clickty-Click, MF, clickty-click.

Does tihs cost money? a Little but consider this my civic duty at the moment. 

Can you advertise? its free, go ahead
Can you _____? Go head try, find out
How do you make money? I don't, I have thoughts how we can make money, but lets just see if this is useful.
